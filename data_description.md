    Here is an explanation of the features/columns in the dataset provided:<br>
<ol>

<li><b>id</b>: This column represents a unique identifier for each data point or sample in the dataset. It is used to distinguish between different instances.</li><br>


<li><b>author</b>: This column indicates the author or source of the data point. It could be the name of the researcher or organization that collected or provided the data.</li><br>


<li><b>geometry</b>: This column describes the geometry or shape of the system or object under study. It provides information about the physical structure or arrangement relevant to the heat transfer process.</li><br>


<li><b>pressure [MPa]</b>: This column represents the pressure applied to the system in units of megapascals (MPa). Pressure is an important factor affecting heat transfer and can impact critical heat flux.</li><br>


<li><b>mass_flux [kg/m2-s]</b>: This column refers to the mass flux, which is the amount of mass flowing per unit area per unit time. It is typically measured in kilograms per square meter per second (kg/mÂ²-s). Mass flux is relevant to heat transfer as it influences the transfer of heat energy through the system.</li><br>


<li><b>x_e_out [-]:</b> This column represents the exit quality, which is the fraction of the mass that has vaporized or turned into a vapor phase at the exit of the system. It is typically a dimensionless value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates fully liquid and 1 indicates fully vapor.</li><br>


<li><b>D_e [mm]:</b> This column represents the equivalent diameter of the system or object under study. It is typically measured in millimeters (mm) and is used to characterize the size or dimensions relevant to the heat transfer process.</li><br>


<li><b>D_h [mm]:</b> This column refers to the hydraulic diameter, which is a characteristic length scale used to represent the cross-sectional area available for fluid flow in a non-circular duct or channel. It is typically measured in millimeters (mm).</li><br>


<li><b>length [mm]</b>: This column represents the length of the system or object under study. It is typically measured in millimeters (mm) and provides information about the extent or size of the system in the direction of heat transfer.</li><br>


<li><b>chf_exp [MW/m2]</b>: This column represents the experimental critical heat flux (CHF) value, which is the point at which a heated surface experiences a rapid increase in temperature. It is measured in megawatts per square meter (MW/mÂ²). This column serves as the target or dependent variable that you would want to predict based on the other features.</li><br>


>These features provide information about the characteristics of the system, such as its geometry, pressure, mass flux, dimensions, and experimental CHF value. They serve as input variables that can be used to build a predictive model for estimating the critical heat flux based on the given features.<br>

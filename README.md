# DL-Critical-Heat-Flux-Prediction
Deep Learning Project on Critical Heat Flux Prediction

This dataset was prepared for the journal article entitled "On the prediction of critical heat flux using a physics-informed machine learning-aided framework" (doi: 10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114540). The dataset contains processed and compiled records of experimental critical heat flux and boundary conditions used for the work presented in the article.

The critical heat flux (CHF) corresponding to the departure fromÂ nucleate boilingÂ (DNB) crisis is essential to the design and safety of a two-phase flow boiling system. Despite the abundance of predictive tools available to theÂ thermal engineeringÂ community, the path for an accurate, robust CHF model remains elusive due to lack of consensus on the DNB triggering mechanism. This work aims to apply a physics-informed machine learning (ML)-aided hybrid framework to achieve superiorÂ predictive capabilities. Such a hybrid approach takes advantage of existing understanding in the field of interest (i.e., domain knowledge) and uses ML to capture undiscovered information from the mismatch between the actual and domain knowledge-predicted target.

The reliability and economic competitiveness of a thermal system hinge upon its safety and regulatory measures. During the stage of system design and analysis, researchers and engineers typically leverage extensive experimental efforts and investigate evolutionary models that represent the state-of-the-art understanding in their fields of specializationâ€”also known asÂ *domain knowledge*Â (DK)â€”to predict various safety limits.

ðŸ§­ **Problem Statement:** The target feature is **chf_exp** which is a continuous variable. The scoring metric is **RMSE**.

## Introduction

Heat flux is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and heat transfer. It plays an important role in many engineering and scientific applications, including the design of heat exchangers, boilers, and meteorological studies. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of heat flux, its mathematical representation, and its various applications.

## What is Heat Flux

Heat flux is the rate at which heat energy flows through a given surface or interface. It is typically measured in units of **watts per square meter (W/mÂ²)** and describes the amount of heat energy transferred per unit area per unit time.

### Key Points:
1. **Positive Heat Flux**: Indicates heat flowing into the surface.
2. **Negative Heat Flux**: Indicates heat flowing out of the surface.
3. **Factors Influencing Heat Flux**: Temperature gradient, thermal conductivity, and the nature of the heat source or sink.

## Mathematical Expression

Heat flux (q) can be expressed mathematically using the formula:

**q = dQ/dtA**

Where:
>**q = heat flux (W/mÂ²)**

>**dQ/dt = rate of heat transfer (W)**

>**A = area of heat transfer (mÂ²)**<br>

### Rate of Heat Transfer

The rate of heat transfer can be calculated using:

**dQ/dt = kAÎ”T/d**

Where:
>**k = thermal conductivity (W/mK)**

>**Î”T = temperature difference (K)**

>**d = thickness of material (m)**

### Simplified Formula

Combining these two formulas, we get:

><b>q = kAÎ”T/dA</b>

which simplifies to:

><b>q = kÎ”T/d</b>

This formula is often used for steady-state heat transfer situations where the temperature and properties of the materials remain constant over time.

## Applications

Heat flux is an important concept in many fields:
- **Thermodynamics**: Describes the transfer of heat between bodies at different temperatures.
- **Engineering**: Crucial in the design of heat exchangers, boilers, and other heat transfer devices.
- **Meteorology**: Used to describe the exchange of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere.

## Description about Dataset

The dataset for this competition was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Predicting Critical Heat Flux (CHF) dataset. The goal of this competition is to impute the null values of **Dryness fraction-x_e_out [-]** feature.

### Key Points:
1. **The dataset consists of two parts**: A training set and a testing set. Both sets contain features that were generated by the deep learning model, which were designed to be similar to the features in the original CHF dataset. However, the distributions of the features in the generated dataset are not exactly the same as those in the original dataset.
2. Participants in the competition are encouraged to explore the differences between the generated dataset and the original dataset, as well as to use the **original dataset as part of their training process** to see if it improves model performance. The competition provides an opportunity to develop and test new methods for predicting critical heat flux, which has important applications in fields such as nuclear power and chemical engineering.

### AIM

- The aim of the dataset is to provide a platform for developing and testing new methods for **predicting critical heat flux (CHF). CHF is a critical parameter in many engineering applications, particularly in the design of nuclear reactors and other thermal management systems**.
- The dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the original CHF dataset, and its features are designed to be similar to the original dataset. **The goal of the competition is to develop models that can accurately predict CHF based on the provided features**.
- By providing this dataset and hosting a competition around it, the aim is to encourage researchers and practitioners to explore new approaches to **predicting CHF**, which could ultimately lead to better understanding and management of thermal systems.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Heat Conduction

Given:
- Thermal conductivity \( k \) = 0.5 W/mK
- Temperature difference \( \Delta T \) = 100 K
- Thickness \( d \) = 0.1 m

Calculate the heat flux using:

\[ q = \frac{0.5 \times 100}{0.1} = 500 \text{ W/mÂ²} \]
